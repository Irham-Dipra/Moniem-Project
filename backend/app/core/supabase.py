from supabase import create_client, Client
#This pulls in the specific tools provided by Supabase.
# Client is the type of object we are creating,
# and create_client is the factory function that makes it.
from dotenv import load_dotenv
#This is a Python library that helps us load environment variables
# from a .env file.
load_dotenv()
#This line loads the environment variables from the .env file.
# It's a common practice to load environment variables at the start of a program.
url: str = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_URL")
key: str = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_KEY")
#This line creates a Supabase client object using the URL and key.
# It's a common practice to create a client object at the start of a program.

#1. Why use os.environ if we have a 
#.env
# file?
#This is a very clever trick we use to make our code work everywhere (on your laptop AND on a professional server).

#The Problem:
#On your LAPTOP, you keep secrets in a 
#.env
# file.
#On a REAL SERVER (like when we deploy this website later), there are no text files allowed for secrets (it's dangerous). Instead, servers have a special settings area called "Environment Variables".
#The Solution:
#Step 1: load_dotenv() looks for your 
#.env
# file. If it finds one, it reads the variables inside and injects them temporarily into Python's "invisible memory" (the Environment Variables).
#Step 2: os.environ.get("...") reads from that "invisible memory".
#So effectively:

#Locally: Code reads 
#.env
# $\rightarrow$ Memory $\rightarrow$ os.environ.get.
#On Server: Server sets Memory directly $\rightarrow$ os.environ.get.
