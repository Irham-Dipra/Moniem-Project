# ==========================================
# REPOSITORY PATTERN EXPLAINED
# ==========================================
# A "Repository" is a design pattern that isolates the database logic.
# Instead of writing raw SQL or Supabase queries directly in your API routes/endpoints,
# you put them methods here.
# BENEFITS:
# 1. Reusability: You can call 'get_all_programs()' from multiple places without rewriting the query.
# 2. Maintainability: If you change your database (e.g., from Supabase to Firebase), you only change this file.
# 3. Readability: API routes become cleaner and just focus on HTTP logic (requests/responses), not DB complexities.

# 1. IMPORT STATEMENTS
from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder
# 'jsonable_encoder' is a FastAPI utility. Pydantic models (schemas) are strict objects.
# Databases often expect simple "JSON-like" types (strings, integers, lists, dicts).
# This function converts complex objects (like Dates, Pydantic Models) into standard Python dicts/lists.

from app.core.supabase import supabase
# This imports our configured Supabase client instance. It's the "connection" to our database.

from app.schemas.program import ProgramCreate, BatchCreate
# Imports Pydantic models. These define the "Shape" of data we expect to receive when creating things.
# They act as a contract/validation layer.

        # Define table names as constants to avoid typos later.
        self.program_table = "program"

    # ==========================================
    # BATCH OPERATIONS
    # ==========================================
    # We manage Batches here too because they are so closely related to Programs.
    # In a larger app, you might split this into its own 'BatchRepository'.

        # '.data' contains the actual list of rows returned by Supabase.

    def create_batch(self, batch: BatchCreate):
        # 1. Convert Pydantic model -> Dict (e.g., BatchCreate(name="B1") -> {"name": "B1"})
